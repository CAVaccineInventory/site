title: California Covid-19 Vaccine Availability
---
**The State of California has
[approved](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/13/956574947/california-to-vaccinate-residents-65-or-older-against-covid-19)
giving the COVID-19 vaccine to people age 65 and older.** We are calling hospitals and pharmacies daily to check which
are currently administering vaccines. Since our first call on January 14th, we've contacted 500+ vaccination sites, and
aim to call several hundred more this weekend (January 16th - 17th). Our goal is getting shots in arms as quickly as
possible for you or your loved ones.
We intend to call [all the vaccination sites in California](./vaccination-sites). If you have
a missing location to report, or think we have incorrect contact information, [please let us
know](https://airtable.com/shrY44NvEjHBscrOH).

We've also compiled county policies on [vaccination here](./county-policies).

        <h3>These places told us they have the vaccine within the last few days. Call before going, or make an appointment, as supplies are limited.</h3>

        <h3>If you can't find the vaccination site you're looking for, it's possible they said they do not have the vaccine, or that we have not contacted them yet.</h3>

        <h3>You can find our full list of sites with their status <a href="{% link vaccination-sites.md %}">here</a></h3>

    <h3><a href="">How Californians are resorting to crowdsourcing to get their Covid-19 vaccine</a></h3>


    <em><p>Californians are taking matters into their own hands: theyâ€™re crowdsourcing it. In the last two days, an effort has sprung up to report on where shots are available to the elderly. Volunteers have set up a spreadsheet with a simple premise: One person can call each location every day and ask if vaccines are available, and then publish the information for everyone to see.</p> 

    <p>... And the site has already been used to get some people vaccinated.</p></em>
