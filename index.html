title: California Covid-19 Vaccine Availability

<section>
    <p>
        <strong>The State of California has
            <a
                href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/13/956574947/california-to-vaccinate-residents-65-or-older-against-covid-19">approved</a>
            giving the COVID-19 vaccine to people age 65 and older.</strong> We are calling hospitals and pharmacies
        daily
        to check
        which
        are currently administering vaccines. Since our first call on January 14th, we've contacted 500+ vaccination
        sites,
        and
        aim to call several hundred more this weekend (January 16th - 17th). Our goal is getting shots in arms as
        quickly as
        possible for you or your loved ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        We intend to call <a href="{% link vaccination-sites.md %}">all the vaccination sites in California</a>. If you
        have
        a missing location to report, or think we have incorrect contact information, <a
            href="https://airtable.com/shrY44NvEjHBscrOH">please let us
            know</a>.</p>

    <p>We've also compiled county policies on <a href="{% link county-policies.md %}">vaccination here</a>.</p>

            appointment, as supplies are limited.</h4>

        <h4>If you can't find the vaccination site you're looking for, it's possible they said they do not have the
            vaccine, or that we have not contacted them yet.</h4>

            <h4><a href="">How Californians are resorting to crowdsourcing to get their Covid-19 vaccine</a></h4>
            <em>
                <p>Californians are taking matters into their own hands: theyâ€™re crowdsourcing it. In the last two days,
                    an
                    effort has sprung up to report on where shots are available to the elderly. Volunteers have set up a
                    spreadsheet with a simple premise: One person can call each location every day and ask if vaccines
                    are
                    available, and then publish the information for everyone to see.</p>

                <p>... And the site has already been used to get some people vaccinated.</p>
