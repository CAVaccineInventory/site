We are an ad hoc collection of volunteers, trying to move as quickly as possible to get Californians up-to-date vaccine information.

Two of us (so you know we're "real people"): [Karl Yang](https://twitter.com/chiefofstuffs) and [@patio11](https://twitter.com/patio11)

**I want to help!**

We do not need more volunteers right now; we're running this out of our networks to move as quickly as possible. This may change in a few days; check back for updates or follow us on Twitter.
We also don't need money. Many charitable projects do; they would appreciate your generous support.

**I am a reporter!**

Please email media@vaccinateca.com ; we'll be in touch quickly.

**I am a medical provider! I have something I want you to know!**

Cool! Please text (415) 301-4597 with your message, institutional affiliation, and an internal extension or contact name so we can call back to verify. We cannot receive photos at this number; text only, please.
One of the organizers will read your message and take action as soon as reasonably possible.

**Does this effort increase or decrease load on the system?**

Most hospitals will get thousands of phone calls per day. They are currently being slammed by many more people than usual asking them the same question: "Do you have the vaccine?" By asking that question and publishing the answer, we can save their phone bandwidth for the day-to-day operations of the hospital. We also save people seeking the vaccine from having to call dozens of locations to find one that has availability.

**Is the information on this website accurate?**

We publish only what the vaccine site told us when we called. The situation is complex, supplies may vary throughout the day, and not everyone at the site might have up-to-the-minute information as to what their policies actually are. We're doing our best, but can't make any guarantees.
