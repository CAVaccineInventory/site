This is a list of all of the sites we are aware of in California which may, at some point, receive the COVID-19 vaccine. **Most of them do not have the vaccine available today**; we are calling as many as we can daily to update the list.
If we missed a site, [let us know](https://airtable.com/shrY44NvEjHBscrOH)! We are working on expanding the list with additional pharmacies and other locations.
