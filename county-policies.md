The state of California has a vaccine strategy, but has delegated prioritization and administration to each county. Decisions as to which patients to vaccinate and in what fashion are ultimately up to medical providers.

We have collected the **most recent county-level information** below. Broadly, we think that if the information we have on file from a county disagrees with a medical provider in it, the one most likely to be right is the one who could (or could not) put a shot in someone's arm.

Some counties have set up scheduling systems or have advice; please check your county below.
