    This is a list of all of the sites we are aware of in California which may, 
    at some point, receive the COVID-19 vaccine. <b>Most of them do not have the 
    vaccine available</b>; we are calling as many as we can daily to update the 
    list so please check the <a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com">latest report
    </a>. If we missed a site, <a href="https://airtable.com/shrY44NvEjHBscrOH">
    let us know</a>! We are working on expanding the list with additional 
    pharmacies and other locations.

county_policies:
  text: |
    The state of California has a vaccine strategy, but has delegated
    prioritization and administration to each county. Decisions as to which
    patients to vaccinate and in what fashion are ultimately up to medical
    providers.

    We have collected the **most recent county-level information** below.
    Broadly, we think that if the information we have on file from a county
    disagrees with a medical provider in it, the one most likely to be right is 
    the one who could (or could not) put a shot in someone's arm.

    Some counties have set up scheduling systems or have advice; please check 
    your county below.

     Safe and reliable COVID-19 vaccines are becoming available to seniors and healthcare workers
     in California. But it can be difficult to find out where and how to get a shot. We call
     hospitals and pharmacies daily to track their vaccine availability and their processes for getting one.

    Safe and reliable COVID-19 vaccines are available to several groups of people in California. 
    But it can be difficult to find out where and how to get a shot.

pre_list_disclaimer:
  disclaimer: |
    We call hospitals, pharmacies, and other health providers across California
    every day to find out if they are currently administering vaccines. The
    medical professionals working at these providers tell us about their current
    vaccination programs and we report what they say here. While we do our best
    to verify all information we receive, we strongly encourage you to check
    with your doctor or local officials if you have questions about a 
    vaccination site.

    VaccinateCA is a community-driven effort to help Californians learn accurate, up-to-date, verified information about

    Our professionals call medical professionals at hundreds of potential vaccination sites daily, asking them if they 
    have the vaccine and if so to whom they will administer it to and how to get an appointment. We write down what 
    they tell us, and publish it to this site.

  faq_toil: |
    Does this effort increase or decrease toil in the healthcare system?
  faq_toil_answr_1: |
    Most hospitals will get thousands of phone calls per day. They are currently being slammed by many more people than 
    usual asking them the same question: "Do you have the vaccine?"
  faq_toil_answr_2: |
    By asking that question and publishing the answer, we can save their phone bandwidth for the day-to-day operations 
    of the hospital. We also save people seeking the vaccine from having to call dozens of locations to find one that 
    has availability.
  faq_accurate: |
    Is the information on this website accurate?
  faq_accurate_answer_1: |
    We publish only what the vaccine site told us when we called. The situation is complex, supplies may vary throughout
    the day, and not everyone at the site might have up-to-the-minute information as to what their policies actually 
    are.
  faq_accurate_answer_2: |
    We're doing our best, but can't make any guarantees.
  faq_who: |
    Who are you?
  faq_who_answer: |
    We are a community-driven organization, with over 300 volunteers working with us. As of January 23rd, 2021, our 
    core team was approximately 20 people.
