  explainer: |
    This is a list of all of the sites we are aware of in California which may, 
    at some point, receive the COVID-19 vaccine. **Most of them do not have the 
    vaccine available**; we are calling as many as we can daily to update the 
    list so please check the [latest report](https://www.vaccinateca.com). If we
    missed a site, [let us know](https://airtable.com/shrY44NvEjHBscrOH)! We are
    working on expanding the list with additional pharmacies and other 
    locations.

county_policies:
  text: |
    The state of California has a vaccine strategy, but has delegated
    prioritization and administration to each county. Decisions as to which
    patients to vaccinate and in what fashion are ultimately up to medical
    providers.

    We have collected the **most recent county-level information** below.
    Broadly, we think that if the information we have on file from a county
    disagrees with a medical provider in it, the one most likely to be right is 
    the one who could (or could not) put a shot in someone's arm.

    Some counties have set up scheduling systems or have advice; please check 
    your county below.

  subtitle: | 
    Safe and reliable COVID-19 vaccines are available to several groups of people in California. 
    But it can be difficult to find out where and how to get a shot. 
    We are a group of volunteers calling hospitals and pharmacies daily to track their vaccine availability and their processes for getting one.

    We call hospitals, pharmacies, and other health providers across California
    every day to find out if they are currently administering vaccines. The
    medical professionals working at these providers tell us about their current
    vaccination programs and we report what they say here. While we do our best
    to verify all information we receive, we strongly encourage you to check
    with your doctor or local officials if you have questions about a 
    vaccination site.
