  We call hospitals, pharmacies, and other health providers across California
  every day to find out if they are currently administering vaccines. The
  medical professionals working at these providers tell us about their current
  vaccination programs and we report what they say here. While we do our best
  to verify all information we receive, we strongly encourage you to check
  with your doctor or local officials if you have questions about a 
  vaccination site.
